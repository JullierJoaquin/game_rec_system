### MLOps Project - Video Game Recommendation System

This repository documents the development of a video game recommendation system. The project is organized into the following key stages:

- [01_ETL](01_ETLipynb): Initial data cleaning scripts.

- [02_EDA](02_EDAipynb): Exploratory data analysis notebooks.

- [03_ML](03_MLipynb): Data preparation and recommendation system implementation.

- [04_API](04_API.ipynb): Deployment files for the recommendation system API.


#### 01_ETL:

    This stage involves the data initial exploration and transformation.


#### 02_EDA:

   Exploration of the data to identify patterns and understand the characteristics of the video game dataset.


#### 03_ML:

   Prepare the data for machine learning and developing the recommendation system.


#### 04_API:

    Deploy the recommendation system as an API and some endpoints with useful information.
